## Quick Introduction

### Welcome to my Path-finding & Sorting algorithms Visualizer, **Algo-Vision**!

This application will bring you a better understanding of how pathfinding & sortition algorithms work by
demonstrating their actions with a nice and fine animation.

Here are some features that my application has to offer:

- Demonstrating famous algorithms, such as A-Star (two heuristics), Dijkstra, DFS and BFS in the pathfinding section,
  and Quick-sort, Merge-sort, Heap-sort, Radix-sort and more, in the sorting section.

- Dynamic pathfinding - a visualization mode that allows you to put midpoints across the board which the
  algorithm will reach, before it reaches the end point. Both midways and walls can be added during the animation (here comes the 'Dynamic').
  In this mode, the algorithm can chase your mouse movement, if enabled.
  **for this purpose, I used the A\* algorithm with 'Diagonal' heuristic.

- Full control of the visualization progress such as Pause & Play, Running speed, Player-Bar (reverse/forward the animation and continue from there), and more.

- Displaying useful information about the algorithm's actions.

- Adjusting the animation's environment and customizing the visualization playground to your flavor.

- Code implementation of each algorithm in Javascript.

- Cool 3D board, and more!

I have built this application with: React, Redux, and Material-UI.

I hope you will enjoy it! :blush: [Algo-Vision on Git-Pages](https://eliya-shalom.github.io/Algo-Vision/)
